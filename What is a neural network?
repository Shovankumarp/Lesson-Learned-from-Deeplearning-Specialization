Problem: Housing price prediction using neural network.
x(size of the house) -> y (price of the house)
input features
  size
  #bedrooms
  zip code
  wealth

(x,y) -given enough training data, neural network works pretty well to accurately mapping the functions



Important Terms:
  -Input features
  -activation function
  -neuron
  -dense connection
  -hidden layer
